## 🎨 LOGO EDITING GUIDE

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Logo Locations

Your website has **TWO LOGO LOCATIONS** that need to be edited together:

#### **Location 1: Intro Animation Logo** (Lines 24-52 in index.html)
This is the large logo shown during the intro animation.

#### **Location 2: Navbar Logo** (Lines 68-97 in index.html)
This is the small logo in the top-left corner.

**Both use the same SVG code**, so edit both for consistency.

## 🎯 Quick Start - Local Editing

### Step 1: Extract Files
- Unzip this folder to your PC

### Step 2: Edit the Logo
1. Open `index.html` with a text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc.)
2. Find the SVG logo code (lines 24-52 and 68-97)
3. Modify the colors:
   - **Dark Navy:** `#021140` → Change to your color
   - **Light Beige:** `#efebe3` → Change to your color

### Step 3: Test Locally
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. See your changes in real-time
3. Adjust colors, sizes, and positions as needed

### Step 4: Deploy
- Send the updated `index.html` back to me
- I'll integrate and deploy the updated website
